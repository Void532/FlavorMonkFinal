# FlavorMonk Frontend

This directory is intended for the client application that will deliver FlavorMonkâ€™s interactive user experience. The frontend will connect to the backend FastAPI service to retrieve personalized recipes, generate grocery lists and interact with the gamified monk characters.

A future iteration of this project may include:

- A web app built with React, Next.js or similar frameworks.
- A mobile application built with React Native or Flutter for iOS and Android support.
- Integration with visual assets and character artwork (Koji, Saffi, Fumi).
- Responsive UI components for meal planning, recipe browsing and grocery list management.

For now this file serves as a placeholder to indicate the purpose of the `frontend` directory.
